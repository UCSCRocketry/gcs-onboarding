# GCS Onboarding Project
Hello! This is the Avionics Ground Control System Onboarding project where you will build a super scaled down version of what we are planning to develop this year and have been working to develop in past years. 
### Goals/Takeaways:
1. Frontend: Be able to use React (a javascript framework) to develop a basic telemetry dashboard frontend that will communicate with the backend via websockets
2. Server: Be able to use Python ( specifically Flask/FastAPI/asyncio) to develop a backend server with simulated telemetry data + use websockets
